### = Why ? What ? and Who ? 

Well as a developper and a gamer i'v decide to create a simple desktop UI to manage better your
packet logger for an MMO RPG game.

Thanks of BladeTiger12 PacketLogger which include a TCP Server since 2018 things become easy to do with web technoglogies.

I'll use Node, Electron and TypeScript to create a desktop APP who will communicate with the PacketLogger Server.
